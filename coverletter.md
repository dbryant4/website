Hi! I believe I can help with this position. It seems as though I performed the exact same role at Millennial Media for the past 2 years. We created tools to automate deployments of various applications as well as orchestrate integration testing.

My team automated the deployment of our highest revenue generating application. It generated around 80% of the company's revenue yet was not automated. We implemented management of configuration using puppet and utilized Ansible to orchestrate the entire deployment process. We wrapped the whole deployment process with a web application so that deployments could be monitored by anyone within the company. This work saved the company 6-8 hours of labor per deploy and increased confidence in deployments. As a side effect, the number of deployments went from once a month to once a day.

I look forward to speaking with you soon! Feel free to take a look at my website (dbryant.xyz) for a link to my github account!
